# one_dimensional_gsl
Rought test to solve the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation using GSL (An Introduction to Computational Physics - Tao Pang)

If you want to compile the code you'll need the [GSL library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). I've done all the development in Windows so I've used the [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) system. You can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or install directly MSYS2.

After that you just have to install the GSL packages using [pacman](https://archlinux.org/pacman/pacman.8.html). pacman is very convinient...

# GUI
The GUI was made with [Tcl/Tk](https://www.tcl.tk/) but you don't need the GUI to use the program. An other useful tool is [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/), you can install it with pacman too.
This's who the GUI looks like
